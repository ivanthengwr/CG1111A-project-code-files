# CG1111A-project-code-files
Contains the description, code, and progress of the project so far

Alright guys so this is what we need to do by the next lab before the mock run.

1. Integrate the required actions code i.e. the turning codes with the LDR reading of the color into our main project code.
2. Fine tune the truning codes to accord that our robot will always sense the center of the black strip
3. Fine tune the part when the robot is about to reach the black strip. i.e when there are no walls, the robot would drift slidely to the right before sensing the black strip
4. LDR will have to denote what is the colour of the white paper to stop and play the celebratory tune.
